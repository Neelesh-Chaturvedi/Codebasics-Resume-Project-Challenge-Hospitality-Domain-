Hospitality Data Analytics Project â€“ Codebasics Resume Challenge

(Medium Difficulty) â€“ Hospitality Domain


Project Overview

This project focused on analyzing hotel booking data to identify revenue leakages, market share loss, 
and optimization opportunities for Atliq Grand, a five-star hotel chain. 
Using Power BI , I developed an end-to-end dashboard to drive data-informed decision-making.

Key Responsibilities & Actions

ðŸ”¹ Situation: Atliq Grand experienced a decline in market share and revenue.


ðŸ”¹ Task: Designed a dashboard to track performance and provide actionable insights.


ðŸ”¹ Action: Analyzed booking trends, revenue patterns & occupancy rates.
           Identified high cancellation rates (24.8%) and no-shows (5%), optimizing booking strategies. 
           Assessed OTA dependency, suggesting strategies to increase direct bookings. 
           Measured realization percentage & property-wise revenue trends for data-driven decision-making.
           
           
ðŸ”¹ Result: The dashboard provided insights to enhance revenue management & market share growth.

Key Findings 

Revenue Loss:
                 Total revenue generated: $2.01 billion
                 Total revenue realized: $1.71 billion
                 ~15% of revenue is lost, likely due to cancellations or unoccupied rooms.

                 
High Cancellation Rate:

24.8% of bookings are canceled
5% are "No Shows", leading to lost revenue

Booking Platform Performance:

"Others" (uncategorized platforms) drive the most bookings (55K+)
Makeyourtrip & Logtrip are key players but may need optimization
Direct bookings (both online & offline) are lower compared to OTAs


Action Plan to Regain Market Leadership & Increase Revenue
Reduce Cancellations & No-Shows
Tighten Cancellation Policies â€“ Shorten free cancellation periods & charge fees for late cancellations.
